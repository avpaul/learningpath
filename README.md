# My Learning Plan

After making a personal assessment and basing on where I want to be in the next 3 months, I designed this learning map to guide me into what I have to learn and how to measure success. Most of the skills here are measured against the simulations project and other 2 side projects that have to demonstrate these skills.

It has 9 main parts(plus 2 other parts), and each part has its own general goal and skills to be learnt other that section. It also have links to resources to be used to achieve that. After starting each part(with a competent understanding of the concepts, the outcomes should be clearly defined.
